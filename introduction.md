# Introduction {#introduction}

Open Test Architecture is an API shipped with HP ALM/QC, for automating background tasks like modifying bulk field values or downloading all of the attachments from the defects module. We can also use this API for Generating bulk reports, custom graphs and have the functionality built which is not available otherwise using the ALM/QC front end application.

OTA APIâ€™s object will be downloaded and registered in the machine when we open ALM for the first time. Once the components are registered, you can use the OTA COM Type Library for connecting ALM using any programming language which supports COM objects.

We will use Excel 2013 for connecting and accessing ALM/QC using OTA API.
