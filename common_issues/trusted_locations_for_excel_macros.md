## Trusted Locations for Excel Macros {#trusted-locations-for-excel-macros}

If the thought of any Excel macro message coming up (even one time) unnerves you, set up a trusted location for your files.

A trusted location is a directory that is deemed a safe zone where only trusted workbooks are placed. A trusted location allows you and your clients to run a macro-enabled workbook with no security restrictions as long as the workbook is in that location.

To set up a trusted location, follow these steps:

1.  On the Developer tab, select the Macro Security button. If you do not find developer tab go to File OptionsTrust Center Trust Center Settings

This activates the Trust Center dialog box.

1.  On the left, click Trusted Locations.

The Trusted Locations menu appears, displaying all the directories that are considered trusted.

Add directories that are considered trusted.

1.  Click the Add New Location button.
2.  Click Browse, and find and select the directory that will be considered a trusted location.

After you specify a trusted location, any Excel file that is opened from this location will have macros automatically enabled.
