# Pre-Requisites {#pre-requisites}

Windows 7 and above, sometimes are tricky with the admin permissions. Hence you must install and register the ALM client using admin privileges as well, if not then using OTA will not work as expected.

Also make sure UAC is disabled (if required) and the webpage must be added to the trusted sites when doing this for the first time.

You may need to manually download and install the Microsoft visual distributable files sometimes if it is a thin client.
